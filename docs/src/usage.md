# Getting Started

## Installation
### First-time Julia Users
SPARLECTRA requires the Julia programming language. You can download Julia from [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/).

### Installing Program Files
To add and register the Sparlectra package, open the Julia REPL and press `]` to enter the Package Manager. Then, execute the following command:

```julia
add https://github.com/Welthulk/Sparlectra.jl
```

The Julia package manager will automatically download the required packages.

> **Hint**: 
For development purposes, you can clone the package from the Git repository and place it in your user directory (e.g., `~/.julia/dev` or `%HOME%/.julia/dev`).

## Running the Power Flow Example using VS Code
Navigate to the `test` folder and open the `testparser.jl` file in VS Code. Press `CTRL+F5` to run the file. Please note that during the first execution, the program will be compiled, which may require additional time. The output will be displayed in the terminal.
