# Change Log
## Version 0.7.6 – 2026-05-11
### Issue #186: Singular Jacobian / World-Age Issue in rectangular NR solver
* Fixed rectangular MATPOWER runs so a singular Newton Jacobian is reported as non-convergence instead of aborting the example, and tightened Julia 1.12 / Revise entry-point calls to avoid world-age binding warnings.
* Fixed the MATPOWER import example so Julia 1.12 / Revise entry points use `Base.invokelatest`, corrected keyword forwarding for damping and start-projection solver options, prevented the MATPOWER fallback diagnostic from enabling PQ-generator voltage-dependent controllers for non-rectangular methods, and added import-safe smoke coverage for those options.

## Version 0.7.5 – 2026-05-10
### New Features 
* Added PV→PQ Q-limit switching start controls (`qlimit_start_iter`, `qlimit_start_mode`, `qlimit_auto_q_delta_pu`) for rectangular power-flow runs.
* Added configurable bus-shunt modeling with classic Y-bus admittance stamping and a rectangular-solver voltage-dependent injection mode for keeping shunt effects in nonlinear mismatch terms.
* Added automatic rectangular Newton damping (`autodamp`) for difficult flat-start power-flow cases; the solver backtracks the Newton step from `damp` down to `autodamp_min` and accepts the first residual-reducing trial.
* Added start projection (`start_projection`) for difficult power-flow seeds, including optional DC-angle starts and raw/DC blend scans for both the internal rectangular solver and external-solver `PFModel` starts.

### Bugfix
* Replaced the singular sparse linear-solve fallback with a rank-revealing QR path before dense SVD fallback to avoid large `pinv`/LAPACK failures in ill-conditioned rectangular Newton steps.
* Wrapped MATPOWER voltage-angle comparison differences into the minimal ±180° range before applying angle tolerances.
* Synthetic tiled-grid benchmark example now falls back from `.yaml` to `.yaml.example` and reports when built-in defaults are used.

### Improvements
* Improved MATPOWER case parsing and network construction performance for large cases by reducing parser allocations, pre-sizing network containers, and avoiding repeated bus-name lookups while adding MATPOWER branches.
  
## Version 0.7.4 – 2026-05-08
### New Features 

### Bugfix
* Fixed YAML subset parser cleanup on parse errors so temporary config files are closed before `mktemp` cleanup on Windows.

### Improvements
* Improved large-network MATPOWER and rectangular-solver performance by aggregating prosumer-derived bus types and specified power injections in linear time. 
   
## Version 0.7.3 – 2026-05-04
### New Features
* Added transformer tap control in AC power flow with an outer-loop controller workflow.
* Added `addTapController!` support for:
  * voltage control via tap ratio (`mode = :voltage`)
  * branch active-power control via phase shift (`mode = :branch_active_power`)
  * coupled ratio + phase control (`mode = :voltage_and_branch_active_power`)
  * tap-control reporting in classic and structured ACP flow outputs

### Improvements
* Updated branch-model documentation with practical controller-direction probing guidance for phase-shift control.

### Tests
* Added regression tests for transformer tap controller behavior.

## Version 0.7.2 – 2026-04-15
### Bug Fixes
* Fixed the increased loading time for large test cases

## Version 0.7.1 – 2026-04-15
### Improvements
* Refactored decision logic for `qlimit_mode = :adjust_vset`:
  * consolidated Q-limit event handling via shared active-set flow
  * extracted voltage-step handling into dedicated helper logic
* Added typed `VoltageAdjustConfig` support for prosumers and integrated it into voltage-regulation detection.
* Simplified rectangular mismatch API by removing unused derivative keyword arguments from `mismatch_rectangular(...)`.

### Solver Robustness
* Rectangular solver now handles reduced Ybus matrices (caused by internal isolated buses) by expanding them back to full network dimension for mismatch/Jacobian processing.
* For rectangular runs with active-link merges and internal isolated buses, solver now uses a rectangular FD fallback path instead of switching to `:polar_full`.

## Version 0.7.0 – 2026-04-15
### New Features
* Added support for **P(U)** and **Q(U)** controller models in power flow calculations
* Characteristic curves can be defined via discrete points, with selectable interpolation methods:
  * linear
  * piecewise constant
  * cubic
  * polynomial
* Added support for controllers on **non-PV generators**
* Added documentation and examples for the new controller features
  
## Version 0.6.4 – 2026-04-12
### New Features
* Marked legacy Jacobian solvers as deprecated:
  * `runpf_full!` / `method = :polar_full`
  * `runpf_classic!` / `method = :classic`
  Both now emit a deprecation warning when used.
* Set rectangular complex Jacobian (`method = :rectangular`) as the default for:
  * `run_acpflow`
  * `run_net_acpflow`
* Updated examples and user documentation to use `:rectangular` as the recommended/default solver method.
### Bugfixes
* For backwards compatibility, if vm is set, the coresponding bus type is set to PV

## Version 0.6.3 – 2026-04-11
### New Features
* Added `:adjust_vset` controller-based Q-limit handling at PV buses (adaptive Vset steps before optional PV→PQ fallback).
* Power-flow bus typing is now derived from attached prosumers (Slack > PV > PQ); `addBus!(busType=...)` is legacy-only and no longer defines operational PF type.

## Version 0.6.2 – 2026-04-02
### New Features
* adding sign validation and optional autocorrection of Q-limits before running power flows.
* Provide an option to lock selected PV buses from being switched to PQ 
* Added pre-run PV Q-limit preview logging in MVAr for easier diagnostics before the PF iteration loop.
## Version 0.6.1 – 2026-03-24
### New Features
* Bad Data Detection (BDD) and Statistical Diagnostics for State Estimation (SE)
  
### Bug Fixes

  `validate_measurements`, `runse_diagnostics`,
  `summarize_se_diagnostics`, and `print_se_diagnostics`.

## Version 0.6.0 – 2026-03-17
### New Features
* Added initial State Estimation (SE, WLS), documentation and examples.
* Added zero-injection-bus (ZIB) support in SE, documentation, and examples.
* Improved results reporting and logging.
* Refactor testsuite for clarity.

### Notes
* State Estimation is currently marked as **experimental**.
* Passive buses / ZIB are currently represented through zero-injection pseudo measurements in the WLS workflow.
